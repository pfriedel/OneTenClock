NOTE: If you follow the spreadsheet, the 5mm is different from the 3mm master
branch.  Use the right branch or figure out your pin mapping on your own.

This code drives a 6x5 array of Charlieplexed LEDs using Jimmie Rodger's LoL
Shield Charliplexing code.  The current target is a standalone board with an
ATmega328 on it, but there's no reason it couldn't be hooked to an Arduino and
run from there.

The code also talks to a DS1307 RTC over I2C using David Brown's
RealTimeClockDS1307 library.

And because I still had 2 pins free, I'm reading the temperature and humidity
off of a DHT11 using Rob Tillaart's DHT11 library from the Arduino Playground.

The 4x5 Font spreadsheets explain the font definition.  It's mostly based on
Jason Kottke's Silkscreen with the Q mangled to not have a 6th row descender,
which is less important on this panel than on the panel where I made that
choice, but since I currently don't display any text, I'm not too concerned.

The options mode is from the MixiClock/WiseClock described on the Wise Time
with Arduino blog.

The Life implementation (and general graphics buffer handling) comes from Ben
Brandt's TinyChuck5, just ported up to a much larger display.
